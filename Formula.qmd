# R-Squared (R²) Calculation Formula

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$

-   $y_i$ are the observed values.
-   $\hat{y}\_i$ are the predicted values from the regression model.
-   $\bar{y}$ is the mean of the observed values.
-   $\sum (y_i - \hat{y}\_i)^2$ is the sum of the squared residuals (SSR).
-   $\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2$ is the total sum of squares (SST).

# **Equation of the Regression Line**

To calculate R-squared (R²), we need to understand how well the regression line predicts the actual data points. The given equation of the regression line is:

$$
\hat{y} = 0.143 + 1.229x
$$

# **Observed Data Points**

From the graph, we can see the observed data points are:

-   (2, 2)
-   (3, 4)
-   (4, 6)
-   (6, 7)

# **Calculate Predicted Values (**$\hat{y}$)

Use the regression line equation to calculate the predicted values for each ( x ):

For $x = 2$:

$$ 
\hat{y} = 0.143 + 1.229 \times 2 = 2.601 \
$$

For $x = 3$:

$$ 
\hat{y} = 0.143 + 1.229 \times 3 = 3.83 \
$$

For $x = 4$:

$$ 
\hat{y} = 0.143 + 1.229 \times 4 = 5.059 \
$$

For $x = 6$:

$$ 
\hat{y} = 0.143 + 1.229 \times 6 = 7.517 \
$$

# **Calculate Residuals (Errors)**

The residual for each point is the difference between the actual ( y ) value and the predicted ( y ) value:

For (2, 2): $$ r_1 = y_1 - \hat{y}_1 = 2 - 2.601 = -0.601 $$

For (3, 4): $$ r_2 = y_2 - \hat{y}_2 = 4 - 3.83 = 0.17 $$

For (4, 6): $$ r_3 = y_3 - \hat{y}_3 = 6 - 5.059 = 0.941 $$

For (6, 7): $$ r_4 = y_4 - \hat{y}_4 = 7 - 7.517 = -0.517 $$

# **Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR)**

Calculate the sum of the squared residuals:

$$
SSR = (-0.601)^2 + (0.17)^2 + (0.941)^2 + (-0.517)^2 = 1.542871
$$

# **Total Sum of Squares (SST)**

Calculate the mean of the observed \$ y \$ values:

$$
\bar{y} = \frac{2 + 4 + 6 + 7}{4} = 4.75
$$

Calculate the total sum of squares:

$$
SST = (2 - 4.75)^2 + (4 - 4.75)^2 + (6 - 4.75)^2 + (7 - 4.75)^2 = 14.75
$$

# **Calculate R-squared (R²)**

Finally, calculate R-squared using the formula:

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST} = 1 - \frac{1.542871}{14.75} = 1 - 0.105 = 0.895
$$

# Conclusion

The R-squared value of 0.895 indicates that approximately 89.5% of the variance in the number of hours spent at the university per day can be explained by the number of lectures per day. This shows a strong relationship between the two variables in this example.
